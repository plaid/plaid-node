     * By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Select Account view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.  To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report\'s data.  Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

The endpoint is idempotent: if a developer has already made a request with the same payment details, Plaid will return the same `recipient_id`.   In the Sandbox environment, you can use the `/payment_initiation/recipient/create` endpoint to generate recipients. Programmatic recipient creation in the Development and Production environments can be done after approval by Plaid\'s compliance team. Please [contact sales](https://plaid.com/contact/) for approval.

     * The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (the list of loan-type accounts supported is the same as for Liabilities; for details, see the `/liabilities/get` endpoint). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](/docs-beta/api/products#investments) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.   Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. Transactions are immutable but can be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](/docs-beta/api/webhooks#transactions-initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](/docs-beta/api/webhooks#transactions-historical_update) webhooks.
