If the user abandons the Link flow (i.e., closes the hosted link webpage or leaves Link open for too long without taking any action), the webhook will be fired 5-15 minutes after the last user interaction. A single Link session may occasionally generate multiple `EVENTS` webhooks. If this occurs, the new webhook will contain all previous events for the session, as well as new events that occurred since the previous `EVENTS` webhook was sent. If this occurs, events can be grouped using the `link_session_id` field and, if necessary, de-duplicated using the `event_id` field.  By default, the `EVENTS` webhook is sent only for sessions where the end user goes through a Hosted Link flow (including Link Recovery flows).

/**
 * The status of the payment.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED`: This is the initial state of all payments. It indicates that the payment is waiting on user input to continue processing. A payment may re-enter this state later on if further input is needed.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`: The payment has been successfully authorised and accepted by the financial institution. For successful payments, this is a potential terminal status. Further status transitions can be to REJECTED and, when supported by the institution, to EXECUTED.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`: The payment has failed due to insufficient funds.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED`: The payment has failed to be initiated. This error may be caused by transient system outages and is retryable once the root cause is resolved.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED`: The payment has been blocked by Plaid. This can occur, for example, due to Plaid flagging the payment as potentially risky. This is a retryable error.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING`: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when the financial institution has authorised the transaction.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED`: The payment was cancelled (typically by the end user) during authorisation.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED`: The funds have successfully left the payer account and payment is considered complete. Not all institutions support this status: support is more common in the UK, and less common in the EU. For institutions where this status is not supported, the terminal status for a successful payment will be `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED`: The payment has settled and funds are available for use. A payment will typically settle within seconds to several days, depending on which payment rail is used. This status is only available to customers using [Plaid Virtual Accounts](https://plaid.com/docs/virtual-accounts/).  `PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED`: The payment was rejected by the financial institution.  Deprecated: These statuses will be removed in a future release.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: The payment status is unknown.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING`: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when processing is complete.  `PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.

/**
 * This webhook is only sent to [Plaid processor partners](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/).  Fired when an Item\'s transactions change. This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook when using the `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint. Note that when using `/processor/transactions/sync` the older webhooks `INITIAL_UPDATE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE`, `DEFAULT_UPDATE`, and `TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`, which are intended for use with `/processor/transactions/get`, will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using `/processor/transactions/sync`.  After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from `/processor/transactions/sync`.  Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, `/processor/transactions/sync` must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the `INITIAL_UPDATE` and `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If `/transactions/sync` is called on an Item that was *not* initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.  This webhook will typically not fire in the Sandbox environment, due to the lack of dynamic transactions data. To test this webhook in Sandbox, call `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`.

 * Fired when an Item\'s transactions change. This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook when using the `/transactions/sync` endpoint. Note that when using `/transactions/sync` the older webhooks `INITIAL_UPDATE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE`, `DEFAULT_UPDATE`, and `TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`, which are intended for use with `/transactions/get`, will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using `/transactions/sync`.  After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from `/transactions/sync`.  Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, `/transactions/sync` must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the `INITIAL_UPDATE` and `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If `/transactions/sync` is called on an Item that was *not* initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.  This webhook will fire in the Sandbox environment as it would in Production. It can also be manually triggered in Sandbox by calling `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`.

 * The `USER_PERMISSION_REVOKED` webhook may be fired when an end user has revoked the permission that they previously granted to access an Item. If the end user revoked their permissions through Plaid (such as via the Plaid Portal or by contacting Plaid Support), the webhook will fire. If the end user revoked their permissions directly through the institution, this webhook may not always fire, since some institutions’ consent portals do not trigger this webhook. Upon receiving this webhook, it is recommended to delete any stored data from Plaid associated with the Item. To restore the Item, it can be sent through [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode).   Note that when working with tokenized account numbers with Auth or Transfer, the account number provided by Plaid will no longer work for creating transfers once user permission has been revoked.

To return new accounts that were created after the user linked their Item, you can listen for the [`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link\'s [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.  `/accounts/get` is free to use and retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. The balance returned will reflect the balance at the time of the last successful Item update. If the Item is enabled for a regularly updating product, such as Transactions, Investments, or Liabilities, the balance will typically update about once a day, as long as the Item is healthy. If the Item is enabled only for products that do not frequently update, such as Auth or Identity, balance data may be much older.  For realtime balance information, use the paid endpoint `/accounts/balance/get` instead.

         * By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.  To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report\'s data.

By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report. To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.  For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call `/asset_report/create` with `options.add_ons` set to `[\"fast_assets\"]`. This will cause Plaid to create two versions of the Asset Report: one with only current and available balance and identity information, and then later on the complete Asset Report. You will receive separate webhooks for each version of the Asset Report.

If you did not initialize Link with the `credit_partner_insights` product or have generated a report using `/cra/check_report/create`, we will call our partners to generate the insights when you call this endpoint. In this case, you may optionally provide parameters under `options` to configure which insights you want to receive.

When testing in Sandbox, you can control the results by providing special test values in the `employer` and `access_tokens` fields. `employer_good` and `employer_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively. `employer_multi` will result in a `HIGH` confidence with multiple payroll options. Likewise, `access_good` and `access_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively.

It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the most up to date Identity information from the Financial Institution. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur for any Identity-enabled Item. If changes to Identity are discovered after calling `/identity/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/identity/#default_update).  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/identity/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Identity and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

         * `/investments/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Investments product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest investment holdings and transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Investments-enabled Item. If changes to investments are discovered after calling `/investments/refresh`, Plaid will fire webhooks: [`HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#holdings-default_update) if any new holdings are detected, and [`INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments_transactions-default_update) if any new investment transactions are detected. Updated holdings and investment transactions can be fetched by calling `/investments/holdings/get` and `/investments/transactions/get`. Note that the `/investments/refresh` endpoint is not supported by all institutions. If called on an Item from an institution that does not support this functionality, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/investments/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Investments and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.  Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial transaction data has loaded (unless you use the `async_update` option). Instead, if transactions data is not ready when `/investments/transactions/get` is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling `/investments/transactions/get` immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.  Data returned by the asynchronous investments extraction flow (when `async_update` is set to true) may not be immediately available to `/investments/transactions/get`. To be alerted when the data is ready to be fetched, listen for the `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook.

If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.  Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.  In Limited Production, payments must be below 5 GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency), and standing orders, variable recurring payments, and Virtual Accounts are not supported.

         * The `/processor/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/processor/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. If no transaction history is ready when `/processor/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

         * The `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/processor/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.  After the initial call, you can call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

         * `/processor/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and `/processor/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee).

         * This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.  The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the corresponding Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.

If the Item does not support Recurring Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.  `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`: Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item.  If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.  `PRODUCT_READY`: Assets webhook to be fired when a given asset report has been successfully generated. If the Item does not support Assets, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.  `ERROR`: Assets webhook to be fired when asset report generation has failed. If the Item does not support Assets, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.

A test clock can be advanced by incrementing `virtual_time`, but may never go back to a lower `virtual_time`.  If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed.  For example, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events.  The advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with the `test_clock`.  For example, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to 80 weeks on each API call.

         * Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.  The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`).   When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.  After the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

         * `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call `/transactions/refresh`.  If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`.  Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/transactions/refresh` is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee).

        /**
         * The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.  `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.  To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

         * Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to authorize a transfer. This endpoint must be called prior to calling `/transfer/create`. The transfer authorization will expire if not used after one hour. (You can contact your account manager to change the default authorization lifetime.)   There are four possible outcomes to calling this endpoint:     - If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer.     - If the `authorization.decision` is `user_action_required`, additional user input is needed, usually to fix a broken bank connection, before Plaid can properly assess the risk. You need to launch Link in update mode to complete the required user action. When calling `/link/token/create` to get a new Link token, instead of providing `access_token` in the request, you should set [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) as the `authorization.id`. After the Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization.    - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`.      - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.  In Plaid\'s Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:    - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.    - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).    - To get an authorization decision of `user_action_required`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call `/asset_report/create` with `options.add_ons` set to `[\"fast_assets\"]`.

If changes to investments are discovered after calling `/investments/refresh`, Plaid will fire webhooks: [`HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#holdings-default_update) if any new holdings are detected, and [`INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments_transactions-default_update) if any new investment transactions are detected.

         * The `/processor/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/processor/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. If no transaction history is ready when `/processor/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.  To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

         * The `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/processor/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.  After the initial call, you can call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams.

         * `/processor/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and `/processor/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee).

        /**
         * This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.  The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the corresponding Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.

         * Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.  The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`).   When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.  After the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

         * `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call `/transactions/refresh`.  If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`.  Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/transactions/refresh` is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        /**
         * The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.  `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.  To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

The transfer authorization will expire if not used after one hour. (You can contact your account manager to change the default authorization lifetime.)   There are four possible outcomes to calling this endpoint:     - If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer.     - If the `authorization.decision` is `user_action_required`, additional user input is needed, usually to fix a broken bank connection, before Plaid can properly assess the risk. You need to launch Link in update mode to complete the required user action. When calling `/link/token/create` to get a new Link token, instead of providing `access_token` in the request, you should set [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) as the `authorization.id`. After the Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization.    - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`.      - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.  In Plaid\'s Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:    - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.    - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).    - To get an authorization decision of `user_action_required`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report. To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.  For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call `/asset_report/create` with `options.add_ons` set to `[\"fast_assets\"]`.

         * `/investments/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Investments product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest investment holdings and transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Investments-enabled Item. If changes to investments are discovered after calling `/investments/refresh`, Plaid will fire webhooks: [`HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#holdings-default_update) if any new holdings are detected, and [`INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments_transactions-default_update) if any new investment transactions are detected. Updated holdings and investment transactions can be fetched by calling `/investments/holdings/get` and `/investments/transactions/get`. Note that the `/investments/refresh` endpoint is not supported by all institutions. If called on an Item from an institution that does not support this functionality, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/investments/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Investments and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.  Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial transaction data has loaded (unless you use the `async_update` option). Instead, if transactions data is not ready when `/investments/transactions/get` is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling `/investments/transactions/get` immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.

         * After creating a payment recipient, you can use the `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.

If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.  Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/get`.

Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/processor/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.

It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and `/processor/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee).

         * This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.  The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`.

         * Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.  The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`).   When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.  After the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

         * `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call `/transactions/refresh`.  If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`.  Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/transactions/refresh` is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        /**
         * The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.  `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.  To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

The transfer authorization will expire if not used after one hour. (You can contact your account manager to change the default authorization lifetime.)   There are four possible outcomes to calling this endpoint:     - If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer.     - If the `authorization.decision` is `user_action_required`, additional user input is needed, usually to fix a broken bank connection, before Plaid can properly assess the risk. You need to launch Link in update mode to complete the required user action. When calling `/link/token/create` to get a new Link token, instead of providing `access_token` in the request, you should set [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) as the `authorization.id`. After the Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization.    - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`.      - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.  In Plaid\'s Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:    - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.    - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).    - To get an authorization decision of `user_action_required`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0.

You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report. To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.  For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call `/asset_report/create` with `options.add_ons` set to `[\"fast_assets\"]`. This will cause Plaid to create two versions of the Asset Report: one with only current and available balance and identity information, and then later on the complete Asset Report. You will receive separate webhooks for each version of the Asset Report.

A `link_token` generated by `/link/token/create` is also used to initialize other Link flows, such as the [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) flow for tokens with expired credentials, or the Identity Verification flow.

     * After creating a payment recipient, you can use the `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.

If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.  Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/get`.

Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`).

This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and `/processor/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.  As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee).

    /**
     * This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.  The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`.

    /**
     * Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.  The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn\'t. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.  This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.  This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`).   When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`.

As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.  `/transactions/refresh` is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

    /**
     * The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.  `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).  This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.  Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.  In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as \"adds\"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.  When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.  Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.  For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.  To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

    /**
     * Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to authorize a transfer. This endpoint must be called prior to calling `/transfer/create`. The transfer authorization will expire if not used after one hour. (You can contact your account manager to change the default authorization lifetime.)   There are four possible outcomes to calling this endpoint:     - If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer.     - If the `authorization.decision` is `user_action_required`, additional user input is needed, usually to fix a broken bank connection, before Plaid can properly assess the risk. You need to launch Link in update mode to complete the required user action. When calling `/link/token/create` to get a new Link token, instead of providing `access_token` in the request, you should set [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) as the `authorization.id`. After the Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization.    - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`.      - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.  In Plaid\'s Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:    - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.    - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).    - To get an authorization decision of `user_action_required`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.    - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.
